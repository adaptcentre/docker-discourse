# hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/discourse

## Introduction

Dockerfile to build a [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) container image.

* This Container uses Debian as a base which includes [s6
overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) enabled for PID 1 Init capabilities, [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org) based on TRUNK compiled for individual container monitoring, Cron also installed along with other tools (bash,curl, less, logrotate, nano, updated postgres-client, vim) for easier management.
* Unlike the official Discourse image, this is meant to be self contained without requiring a base image or use the `launcher`
* Nginx performance report removed, SQL Query, Voting and Solved Plugins installed.

## Prerequisites

This image assumes that you are using a reverse proxy such as [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) and optionally the [Let's Encrypt Proxy Companion @ https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) in order to serve your pages. However, it will run just fine on it's own if you map appropriate ports.

You will also require an external Redis container, along with an external Postgres DB container, as well an an external SMTP server.



## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/discourse) and is the recommended method of installation.


```bash
docker pull tiredofit/discourse:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available:

* `latest` - Most recent stable release of PHP w/Debian Jessie

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

To get started:
- cd to the examples directory
- update the `DISCOURSE_HOSTNAME`, `DISCOURSE_DEVELOPER_EMAILS`
- optionally expose map port 3000 of the discourse-app service to port 80, so it reachable without 
- run `$ docker-compose up`
```
# â€¦
    networks:
      - proxy
      - services
    ports:
      - 80:3000
````

If JS files have are not loading try regenerate them
- `$ docker exec -it discourse-app bash`
- `$ rails assets:precompile`

## Configuration

### Data-Volumes

The container operates heavily from the `/app` folder, however there are a few folders that should be persistently mapped to ensure data persistence. The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory             | Description       |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| `/app/log`            | Logfiles          |
| `/app/public/uploads` | Uploads Directory |
| `/app/public/backups` | Backups Directory |

### Database

Edit the environment variables to point to a working Postgres Server with the appropriate credentials, and create a database with the name `discourse` and assign appropriate permissions. The database will automatically populate and also upgrade upon startup if the discourse version changes with new releases of this image.

### Environment Variables

Along with the Environment Variables from the [Base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/debian), below is the complete list of available options that can be used to customize your installation.
